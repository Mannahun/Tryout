    "Crimes often concentrate in specific areas or neighborhoods of a city, which, for specific socio-economic factors, may be more conductive to illicit activities. The availability of geo-spatial data allows for computational analysis of such factors and a deeper understanding of patterns that most often associate with increasing crime rates. Such data is of interest to policy-makers who may have to plan and promote the economic development of neighborhoods or design specific  interventions aiming at decreasing crime rates indirectly by acting on the social fabric of poor or depressed areas. The purpose of the present project is to assess whether criminal activities correlate with the presence of a specific social pattern, as it can be inferred from the commercial activities on the territory of the city of Toronto. By developing a model or highlighting specific associations, this analysis may help local administration to better plan the city development."
